	<li><h3>Mix together the joshinko non-glutinous rice flour, shiratamako glutinous rice flour and sugar. Add the hot water little by little, mixing well until the mixture takes on the consistency of an earlobe. This is the traditional way to describe the perfect texture for your dango mixture.</li></h3>
	<li><h3>Cover the bowl you mixed your dango mixture in and microwave for 3 minutes. Using damp hands or alternatively a dampened pestle from a suribachi, knead the dough.</li></h3>
	<li><h3>Divide the dough into thirds.  Add the food colouring to one third and the matcha to another third. The last one will be left as is. If the matcha powder is too hard to combine, add a little water to the matcha powder to make a paste before mixing in.</li></h3>
	<li><h3>Dampen your hands again and roll the dough into 6 evenly sized balls for each colour. Thread one of each colour onto a bamboo skewer and serve as a sweet treat.</li></h3>
