	<center><h1><font color="Yellow">Ramen</h1>
	<h3><font color="Yellow">By 1900, restaurants serving Chinese cuisine from Canton and Shanghai offered a simple ramen dish of noodles (cut rather than hand-pulled), a few toppings, and a broth flavored with salt and pork bones. Many Chinese living in Japan also pulled portable food stalls, selling ramen and gyoza dumplings to workers. By the mid-1900s, these stalls used a type of a musical horn called a charumera to advertise their presence, a practice some vendors still retain via a loudspeaker and a looped recording. By the early Showa period, ramen had become a popular dish when eating out.</font></h3>
